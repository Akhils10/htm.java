# What Does A Fox Eat?

This the HTM.java version of Subutai Ahmad's Hackathon Demo illustrating the 
integration of HTM technology; Cortical.io's Natural Language Programming (NLP)
technology; and the HTM.java Network API.

This demo demonstrates the powerful similarity and word association technology of
Cortial.io and the generalization power of HTM technology by "teaching" the HTM triplets
of animals, actions, and objects such as "frog eats flies", and "cow eat grain". After
presenting the HTM with 36 different examples of triplet animal "preferences", we then
ask the HTM what a "fox" would eat.

The HTM, having never "seen" the word fox before, comes back with "rodent" or "squirrel",
which is what an animal that is "fox-like" might eat. Cortical.io's "Semantic Folding" 
technology, utilizes SDRs (Sparse Data Representations) to encode property qualities to
sparse data bits. The use of this technology to reverse engineer the HTM's "prediction"
to see what "meal" the HTM generalizes for foxes, exhibits vast potential in the combination
of these two advanced Machine Intelligence technologies.
