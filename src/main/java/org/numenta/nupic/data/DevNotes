Remove all direct setting of connected synapses. (i.e. all setConnections addConnections methods
    [allow internal setConnections only]) 
Allow retrieval of connected synapses - so array of connecteds will be needed but no direct setting
Only (internally) update connected synapses array when/where permanences get adjusted above synPermConnected

Most useful hierarchical view is obtained by opening the call hierarchy of Pool.setPermanence(Synapse, double)

Add the inputIndex to Synapses and synapse creation methods.

Redo Pool.setPermanence(Synapse, perm) method so that the index reflects

TODO: separate structure from data. Ideas of what this looks like now include:
	a.) Static (Structure)
		Columns, Cells, ProximalDendrites, Proximal Synapses (Pool inputs too)
	b.) Dynamic (Data)
		DistalDentrites, Distal Synapses, permanences, duty cycles
	c.) Parameters
		Thresholds, inc's, dec's, radii, potentialPct, MaxBoost, synPermConnected
