Remove all direct setting of connected synapses. (i.e. all setConnections addConnections methods
    [allow internal setConnections only]) 
Allow retrieval of connected synapses - so array of connecteds will be needed but no direct setting
Only (internally) update connected synapses array when/where permanences get adjusted above synPermConnected

Most useful hierarchical view is obtained by opening the call hierarchy of Pool.setPermanence(Synapse, double)
